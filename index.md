### A porting specialist

Recently, Iâ€™ve been redesigning, refactoring, and porting C++ software to Go, improving design clarity and ensuring long-term sustainability.

Iâ€™ve also worked with languages like Rust, Python, NodeJS, and PHP to solve specialized problems effectively. Iâ€™m also well-versed in other key components of the tech stack, including databases, message brokers, and network protocols.

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of working on many projects: from embedded arm64 firmware for edge computing to Python software for nlp, distributed storage networks, RESTful APIs, smart contract, and homelab setups that broadened my devops expertise and toolset.

Iâ€™ve also led a team of 5+ team members, across various roles and experience levels.

Above all, Iâ€™m a friendly team player who enjoys solving problems together and lightening the mood with my irreverent sarcasm during high-pressure moments.
